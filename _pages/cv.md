## Experience

- Ph.D. Student, IBM and Telecom SudParis, 2019 - Current
  - About the ability to any generative probabilistic model to define a discriminative classifier, parametrized with neural networks, with application to Natural Language Processing. These thesis allows to develop neural models based on Probabilistic Graphical Models, combining great modeling potential, performances, and easy to serve.
  - Some research projects:
    - Developing extensions of the classifier induced from the Naive Bayes for Text Classification and Sentiment Analysis, dividing the error by $4.5$ while keeping the same complexity.
    - Developing new algorithms for Hidden Markov Chain, allowing to consider complex features and achieving relevant results for Part-Of-Speech Tagging, Named-Entity-Recognition, state-of-the-art results for Chunking, and being easy to serve.
    - Showing the equivalence between the linear-chain Conditional Random Field and the Hidden Markov Chain.
  - Tech: Python, PyTorch, Transfomers, Flair

- Data Scientist Consultant, IBM France, November 2018 - April 2019
  - Data scientist developing a long-tail chatbot using state-of-the-art Question Answering models (BERT) in French coupled with a document retriever module (based on Elastic Search)
  - Other projects: clustering of unsupervised data, mail classification, data analysis
  - Tech: Python, Tensorflow, Keras, Jupyter, Flask, Scikit-learn, GoogleCP, ElasticSearch
}

- Data Scientist Intern, IBM France, May 2018 - November 2018
  - Development of a database enrichment model lying on user questions, based on the sequential neural model BiLSTM, then BERT, query analysis, and word embedding methods GloVe and FastText.

- Others: research intern during summer 2016 and summer 2017 at Telecom SudParis - Paris, and developer intern during summer 2015 at Bo Digitize Ltd - Tel Aviv
