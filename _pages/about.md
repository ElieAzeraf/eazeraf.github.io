I am a Ph.D. candidate in Data Science and Machine Learning at Hadamard Doctoral School of Mathematics, doctoral school of Paris-Saclay University (1st in Mathematics in the Shanghai Ranking) and Institut Polytechnique de Paris (31st in Mathematics).

I am doing my Ph.D. with the SAMOVAR lab, affiliated with the CNRS, at Telecom SudParis, Institut Polytechnique de Paris.

I am interested in Probabilistic Models and Neural Networks applied to Natural Language Processing applications. I create light and powerful models based on probabilistic generative models, parametrized with neural network functions, which can achieve relevant results and are easy to serve.
