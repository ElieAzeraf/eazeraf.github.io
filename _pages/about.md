I am a PhD candidate in Data Science and Machine Learning at Ecolde Doctorale de Math√©matique Hadamard, doctoral school of Paris-Saclay University (1st in Mathematics in the Shanghai Ranking), Institut Polytechnique de Paris (31st in Mathematics), and PSL University (13th in Mathematics).

I am doing doing my Ph.D. with the SAMOVAR lab, affiliated with the CNRS, at Telecom SudParis, Institut Polytechnique de Paris.

I am interested in Probabilistic Models and Neural Networks applied to Natural Language Processing applications.
