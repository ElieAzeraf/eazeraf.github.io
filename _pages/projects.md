# Hidden Markov Chain for Chunking

- Using the Hidden Markov Chain with new algorithms I have developed for syntactic sentence decomposition, or Chunking.
- Model acheving state-of-the-art results on the reference dataset, CoNLL 2000, while having much faster inference times:
- Details are available in a submitted paper.
